<h1>Business at the Crossroads</h1>
<br>

<p>
Business at the Crossroads is a project to collect oral histories, photographs, and artifacts related to changes in the Ogden business district since World War II.  Special Collections will spend the summer of 2013 focusing on two aspects of the project: oral history interviews with community members who have lived and worked on 25th Street, and historical rephotography of 25th Street buildings.
</p>

<h3>Oral History Interviews</h3>
<p>
We invite the community to share with us memories and stories of 25th Street. While our oral histories are currently focused on 25th Street, we will expand the project in the fall to include other downtown areas, with a particular emphasis on Hispanic business owners.
</p>

<h3>Historical Rephotography</h3>
<p>
Pulling from the Weber County Assesor's Photograph Collection, and from the Union Station Library, six photography students will recreate historical images of 25th Street.  They will also photo-document the men and women currently working on 25th Street through a series of portraits. These "then-and-now" images will become the foundation of our exhibit opening next spring.
</p>
