<h3>Immigrants at the Crossroads</h3>

<p>
In 2014-15, we decided to document this experience of immigrant populations that helped shape the history of Ogden. We interviewed over 20 people from Japanese, Greek, Italian, and Dutch heritage to get their views on growing up in Ogden. 
</p>

<p>
These interviews were showcased along with rephotography of businesses and places that were important to each of the ethnic communities. The project showed that Ogden has always had a diverse community and it is that diversity that helped shape Ogden.
